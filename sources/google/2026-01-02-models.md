## Model version name patterns

Gemini models are available in either stable, preview, latest, or experimental versions.

- **Stable**: Points to a specific stable model. Most production apps should use a specific stable model. Example: gemini-2.5-flash
- **Preview**: Points to a preview model which may be used for production. Will be deprecated with at least 2 weeks notice. Example: gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025
- **Latest**: Points to the latest release for a specific model variation. This alias will get hot-swapped with every new release. Example: gemini-flash-latest
- **Experimental**: Points to an experimental model. Not suitable for production use. Example: gemini-2.0-flash-exp

Notes:
- All 2.5 and 3.0 series models support 1M input tokens and 65K output tokens
- All 2.0 series models support 1M input tokens but only 8K output tokens
- Thinking is fully supported in 2.5+ models, experimental in 2.0 Flash, not supported in 2.0 Flash-Lite
